<p align="center">
  Gag Combos Info is a single-page application created with React.js, designed to help players of the game Toontown Rewritten find the best combination of gags to use in any battle. The application takes in the number of players, any players’ weapons with special abilities, and the enemy’s level, then uses an efficient algorithm to generate a filterable list of all optimized combinations of weapons that defeat the enemy in a single turn.
