The bonus from using throw or squirt on a lured cog is 50% of 
the combined damage of all gags, rounded up.

The bonus from using multiple gags from a single track on the 
same cog is 20% of the combined damage of all gags, rounded up.

Even if all these bonuses are applied all at once, they'll be 
rounded separately and then added together (not added before 
rounding.)
