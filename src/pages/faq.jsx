                      Toontown Online was an MMORPG, initially developed by Disney and Schell Games in 2003.
                      After Disney shut down Toontown in 2013, various fan-made, free-to-use revivals of the game eventually popped up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the most popular of these revival servers is Toontown Rewritten, which began development only months after Toontown Online shut down, and strives to be as close to the original Toontown as possible.

                      Toontown players play as "Toons", and engage in turn-based battles with enemies known as "Cogs".
                      In these battles, Toons attempt to defeat Cogs using combinations of "gags". The cog deals damage to the players each round until it is defeated, or until the players' toons "go sad".

                    <p>
                      This website's "Calculator" page lets you select any combination of gags and shows you which cogs it will defeat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This website's "Recommendations" page finds the optimal combinations of gags that can defeat a cog in one round, based on a number of different factors that you input.

                      At this time, Gag Combos Info only provides information about Toontown Rewritten,

                      However, this website is still in development, and we hope to support CC in the future!

                      "Best" Gag Combos are arbitrarily defined as combos meeting the following criteria:

                    <ul>
                      <li>

                        Total Combo Damage satisfies the following inequality:
                        <code>[Cog HP] &lt;= [Combo Damage] &lt;= [Cog HP] + ceil(sqrt([Cog HP]) / 2)</code>

                        The combo is not flagged as "bad" based on the utilized tracks,
                        which happens for Drop-Only Combos (due to low accuracy),
                        and Sound-on-Lured-Cogs-before-Throw-or-Squirt 
                        (due to it preventing lured knockback damage).
                        Note that Sound-Only-on-Lured-Cogs is not flagged 
                        since a successful Lure gives the Sound 100% accuracy.

                      In Toontown Rewritten, the probability that a gag hits a
                      cog is called <code>atkAcc</code>, or attack accuracy, 
                      and is defined by the equation <code>
                        atkAcc = propAcc + trackExp + tgtDef + bonus
                      </code>.

                      Gag Combos Info (in its current state) must make some assumptions in this equation for each gag in a recommended gag combo

                          <code>propAcc</code> for Lure gags is based on the cog level.
                          A recommended combos' Lure gag is chosen using the following table:

                          Lure gags have an accuracy that varies from 50% to 95%, 
                          so this choice does affect combo accuracy, but is more reasonable to gameplay, 
                          as it doesn't over-recommend high-level Lure gags.
                        </p>

                          <code>trackExp</code> is assumed to be at its maximum value of 60.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Although this assumption inflates the probabilities of low-level gag combos,
                          it gives more accurate probabilities relating to end-game scenarios 
                          where high-level gag combos may utilize low-level gags.

                          <code>tgtDef</code> is capped at its level 12 value for level 13+ cogs.

                        <p>
                          Toontown Rewritten support confirmed via email on 2023-07-10 that level 13+ tgtDef values
                          are being kept secret to keep the mystery in Field Offices (the only in-game area containing level 13+ cogs).
                          They also warned that these values are occasionally tweaked and are subject to change,
                          and that anyone claiming to know these values may be incorrect. Thus, Gag Combos Info 
                          disregards hearsay that level 20 tgtDef is -65, instead opting to cap tgtDef at -55 for all 13+ cogs until further notice.

                        <p>
                          <code>prevHits</code> assumes all previous gags in the combo have hit.
                          This is a necessary assumption to the probability that the entire combo is successful.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          <code>luredRatio</code> assumes that there is exactly 1 cog in the battle.
                          This is because the recommendations page recommends combos based on a single cog.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                      After obtaining each gag's probability, Gag Combos Info multiplies the gag probabilities together,
                      using only the maximum gag probability from groups of gags in the same track.
                      Lastly, this number is rounded to 1 decimal place.
